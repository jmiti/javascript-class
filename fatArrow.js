/*
we dont use arrow funtions while defining objects
paramatised funtion is:
-string intapolations
syntax of a fat array funtion:
functionname = () =>{
-HOW ARE FAT ARROW FUNTIONS DEFINED
-THE THREE WAYS TO DEFINE A FUNTION :
-array funtiond make code shorter
-in a funtion the vary last code should be the return statement (always comes last)
-defining arrow fuction

}

*/
/*Standard function expression
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Arrow function expression
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
*/
//concise way of writing an arrow funtion that has one line of code in the body
const sum1 = (a,b) => a + b
//however if the body has more  than one line of code then we need to have curly braces to enclose
{console.sum2 = (a,b)=>
console.log(a+b)
return 'the result is ${a+b} per calculation'
}
